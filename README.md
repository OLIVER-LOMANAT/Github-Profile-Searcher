# GitHub-Profile Searcher

This is a small web app that helps you find GitHub user profiles.  
You can search for someone’s GitHub username and see their profile info and list of repositories.

## What it does

- You type a GitHub username in the box.
- Click the search button.
- It shows the user’s picture, name, followers, following, and number of repos.
- It also shows a list of their public repositories with links.
- You can switch between light mode and dark mode.

## How to use it

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Type a GitHub username (like `octocat`) in the input box.
3. Click the magnifying glass button.
4. See the user’s profile and repos appear below.
5. Use the toggle switch to change between light and dark mode.

## What you need

- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
- Internet connection (to get data from GitHub)

## Note

The app uses a GitHub token to get data without limits.  
If you want, you can replace the token in `index.js` with your own, or remove it and still use the app (but it may stop working if you make too many searches quickly).
